Today I explored a fun and challenging game problem called the Zip Game — a puzzle that really pushes your recursion and backtracking skills to the next level!
🔁 Recursion
🔍 Backtracking
🧩 Problem-solving

💻 The idea is to determine whether two input strings can be interleaved in order to form a third string.
The twist? Every character must be used, and order must be preserved — classic backtracking territory!

Input / Output Formate :
# Input Representing in the matrix formate with given for empty cell represent it by 0
mm=[[11,0,0,6,0,7],
    [0,0,10,0,1,0],
    [0,3,0,5,0,0],
    [9,0,4,0,0,0],
    [0,2,0,0,0,0],
    [8,0,0,0,0,0]]

# Output
DDDLLLUURDRUUURRDDDDDLLLLLUUUURRULL


🧠 Core Concepts Applied:

Recursive branching to explore combinations

Backtrack when a branch fails

Base case to stop the recursion when all paths are validated

✅ Implemented using clean and efficient Python code
✅ Optimized to avoid redundant calls
✅ Readable and ready to scale!
