# Just Solved the Linkedin Zip Game using Python.


Today I explored a fun and challenging game problem called the Zip Game — a puzzle that really pushes your recursion and backtracking skills to the next level!
🔁 Recursion
🔍 Backtracking
🧩 Problem-solving

💻 The idea is to determine whether two input strings can be interleaved in order to form a third string.
The twist? Every character must be used, and order must be preserved — classic backtracking territory!

🧠 Core Concepts Applied:

Recursive branching to explore combinations

Backtrack when a branch fails

Base case to stop the recursion when all paths are validated

✅ Implemented using clean and efficient Python code
✅ Optimized to avoid redundant calls
✅ Readable and ready to scale!
